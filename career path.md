# Data scientist
⚬ Don't just dive into advanced topics too quickly (e.g. Deep learning), stick with foundations (SQL, Stats, Data Wrangling, etc..)
⚬ Do learn theory, but put more focus on implementation
⚬ Do read library documentations and test it out
⚬ Don't rely on your degrees too much, keep making those projects
⚬ Don't just apply to the job titles, actually read the descriptions and pick what's best
⚬ Do an end-to-end project and make sure you understand the entire lifecycle completely
⚬ Don't underestimate the value of domain knowledge
⚬ Don't stop practicing your communication skills
