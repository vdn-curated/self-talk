No, I think they a becoming more distinct, but both terms are quite vague at present and their meaning is often overwhelmed by “hot new silver bullet” thinking.

Once upon a time there was a field called Data Processing. It recognized that data and process were inseparable sides of the same coin, but some people preferred to look at just one side of the coin. The process folks came up with structured programming and object oriented design while the data folks delivered relational databases and data warehouses. I started out (1963) heavily process oriented, but by the late 1980’s I found that the data perspective provided better insight in some key areas. Today I look at both sides of the coin, but I spend more time looking at the data side.

To continue the story at some point someone pointed out that our goal is to provide useful information so we changed our name to Information Technology. Same thing, just a different emphasis.

Now let’s suppose we are running a nation-wide heavy truck (18 wheeler) repair business. In the early days we might want to know how many truck we repaired in Chicago. That’s something a simple DP system could answer rather unambiguously. Just look at the shop report and you have your answer.

With some maturity the question of building a new shop in a new area arises and we have the question: How many of our customer’s trucks are in Ohamha? Not so easy to answer. What do you mean “in Ohamha?” Inside the city limits? Inside the Metropolitan Statistical Area? Inside some other boundary? Home based there? Routinely maintained there? Occasionally maintained there? Actually there today? We probably need some analytic help to frame the right question and to find a way of collecting an accurate answer. The data processing effort might not be much greater than before but defining our need requires some deeper business understanding.

In a few years we need to expand our business and we want to compare the number of truck we service in each area to the potential that need service. This is even more complex. How do we recognize a potential customer Truck? Defining this will required more business understanding and getting the answer will require more DP work.

Today we decide we want to know what potential customers think of us by searching Twitter. This is not a task for DP. This is big dirty ambiguous data. We need a Data Scientist to make sense of all this. This guy cares about finding meaning in data that the originator did not intend to provide. In doing his job this person may see the need for improvement in DP systems and may even demand them, but improving a DP system is not his job as a Data Scientist.

Now to me a Data Engineer (a recent term in my experience) is a DP guy with like me with a strong interest in the data side of the coin: Well defined data, data quality, well organized databases, high performance data warehouses, etc.

Since both Data Science and Data Engineering require a growing body of knowledge at overlaps but has significant difference, I see these area growing apart because it will become increasingly difficult for one person to maintain mastery of both areas.

I’ll give you an example of this in a related area. In 1969 I took a graduate course in computer graphics. I suspect I learned about 10% of the state-of-the-art in that area. Today I’d probably have to get a Masters in computer graphics to reach that level. There is just so much more to know because of progress. So, our field keeps generating new specialties because of our human limitations. This will certainly be true of Data Science and Data Engineering.
